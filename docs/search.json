You can connect to the visitor wlan from uni basel as follows: Connect your laptop to it and open a browser. You will then get a code via SMS that you can use to connect. Or, as backup and because it’s sometimes just easier: Use your phone as a hotspot.\nIf you want to have a look at the slides, they are available at the following link. And finally, since this is a really a mini workshop and we don’t want to loose too much time with the setup, you can access an RStudio server environment with the following link, where everything is hopefully already prepared and setup."

And they give the following definition in their book. They define it as a toolset of methods and processes that makes ML actually available for non-experts."

    "text": "What is automated machine learning?\n\nA schematic for the typical modeling process (Silge & Kuhn, 2023).\nBut to give you a bit more of a practical idea i think a good way to understand it is to have a look at a typical modelling process: Let’s say you have a specific use case at hand - lets say you forgot to ask who wants a vegetarian dinner for lunch and you should now predict it as good as possible based on the info from the participants. So you start to explore your data, you may have a look at age or gender, you may create new features that could give a hint to eating preferences of the people and you start to build some models. But which algorithm should you use? Maybe just linear regression that the cook will understand your prediction? Maybe something new and fancy like a gradient boosting? You start building and comparing algorithms but then you realize that you made an error with the newly calculated features and you have a wrong encoding somewhere…so before you come up with a final model, people actually just left for a nearby restaurant.\nSo as you can see, building a prediction or classification model can be very time-consuming."

Depending on your specfic data and use case, some algorithms are more suitable than others."
