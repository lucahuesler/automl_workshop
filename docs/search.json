You can connect to the visitor wlan from uni basel as follows: Connect your laptop to it and open a browser. You will then get a code via SMS that you can use to connect. Or, as backup and because it’s sometimes just easier: Use your phone as a hotspot.\nIf you want to have a look at the slides, they are available at the following link. And finally, since this is a really a mini workshop and we don’t want to loose too much time with the setup, you can access an RStudio server environment with the following link, where everything is hopefully already prepared and setup."

But before i do that, a quick note on myself so that you know who is actually talking to you: My name is Luca Hüsler, i work for the Amt für Daten und Statstik in Basel-Landschaft where im responible for the cantonal register of buildings and dwellings, as well as for the section of “Territory and environment”. Also, im about to finish a master in data science at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and actually what we will do today is closely related to my master’s thesis where automated machine learning was an important component.\nSo, what is the plan for this hour?\nAs this is a workshop, you can not just lean back and listen to me. Of course i will not force you to do that, but for those who actually want to follow along, i will give you some info to get ready.\nThen, in the first 20 minutes, i will give you a very quick overview of the concept of autoML and why or when this can be interesting. Then, another short intro to the framework tha we will be using: H2O and after this, things will become more practical and we will jump right into the code and how you actually run this in R.\nIn the second part, i prepared a little use case that we will use as example. This will be a hands-on session where you will have the possibility to run and explore AutoML. Of course, this is more of a sneak preview of what you can do with it. But if some of you got curious about maybe have some ideas how to use it in one of your projects - then i consider that workshop as fully successful!"

So there must be something about it…"

    "text": "What is automated machine learning?\n\nA schematic for the typical modeling process (Silge & Kuhn, 2023).\nBut to give you a bit more of a practical idea i think a good way to understand it is to have a look at a typical modelling process: Let’s say you have a specific use case at hand - lets say you forgot to ask who wants a vegetarian dinner for lunch and you should now predict it as good as possible based on the info from the participants. So you start to explore your data, you may have a look at age or gender, you may create new features that could give a hint to eating preferences of the people and you start to build some models. But which algorithm should you use? Maybe just linear regression that the cook will understand your prediction? Maybe something new and fancy like a gradient boosting? You start building and comparing algorithms but then you realize that you made an error with the newly calculated features and you have a wrong encoding somewhere…so before you come up with a final model, people actually just left for a nearby restaurant.\nThis process can be very tedious and time-consuming and also, it requires a lot of coding knowledge. And thats where AutoML comes into play: AutoML tries to automate and streamline the machine learning workflow"

    "text": "…and why use it?\n\nChoosing the best algorithm: There is no single best algorithm (“No free lunch” theorem)\nAvailability: Reduce the need for expertise in machine learning\nError reduction: Standardized approach that guarantees same operations to all models\nEfficiency: Automation of iterative tasks, more time to focus on model evaluation and explainability\n\n\nSo that directly brings us to the question: Why or when can AutoML be helpful?\nFirst and in my opinion the most important: You can actually not know what is the best algorithm for your use case. Depending on your specfic data and use case, some algorithms are more suitable than others."
